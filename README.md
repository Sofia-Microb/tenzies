# This is Tenzies!

A simple, one-page app based on the popular game of dice in which you race to get the same number on every die.

This game was constructed following the [React Course in Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact), but some custom changes were incorporated that made it more robust and a timer was added to increase competitivity.

## Let's do this :muscle:

_You can get a local copy of this project and use it for developing purposes or whatever you want. You are going to need an editor (like Visual Studio Code), NodeJS and Git._

### Clone it from GitHub :hammer_and_wrench:

    git init
    git clone https://github.com/Sofia-Microb/ringo_app_new.git
    npm install
    npm start
